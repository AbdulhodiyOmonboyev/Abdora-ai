IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULE: Never use markdown syntax anywhere in the JSON
values below - no **bold**, no # headers, no markdown bullets like "- " or
"* ". Write plain, clean text. Wherever a field should contain multiple
items, use the JSON array structure specified for that field instead of
embedding a formatted list inside a single string.

You are creating a short narrated "video" (a slide-by-slide explainer) that teaches this topic clearly, the way a patient teacher would on a whiteboard.

Topic: "${title}"
Source content: "${(content || title).slice(0, 2500)}"

Break the topic into 5-8 slides that build on each other logically (definition → rule/mechanism → examples → common mistakes → summary).

Return valid JSON with this exact shape:
{
  "topic": "short topic title",
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "short slide heading (max 6 words)",
      "bullets": ["short bullet point", "short bullet point", "..."],
      "narration": "what the narrator says out loud for this slide - natural spoken sentences, 2-4 sentences, matching and expanding on the bullets, suitable for text-to-speech",
      "imagePrompt": "a prompt for an AI image generator to illustrate this slide's idea - describe a simple, clean, educational illustration (flat design or friendly diagram style) that visually represents the concept. Never ask for any text, letters, numbers, or labels to appear in the image - describe only visual elements, shapes, and scenes."
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- 5-8 slides total.
- Each slide: 2-4 short bullets (max ~8 words each), one narration block, and one imagePrompt.
- The last slide must be a short summary/recap.
- Narration must sound natural when read aloud, not like a list.
- imagePrompt must always explicitly avoid text/letters/numbers in the image (image models render text badly), and should describe a single clear, simple educational visual, not a busy scene.
- Do not use markdown syntax anywhere (no **bold**, no # headers, no "- " list markers) - plain text only in every field.`;

${langNote[language] || langNote['uz']}

Your job:
- Have a real spoken conversation with the student to practice speaking.
- The moment the student makes a grammar, pronunciation, word-choice, or fluency mistake, interrupt the flow briefly to correct it directly and clearly - do not let mistakes slide by uncorrected and do not soften the correction into vagueness.
- State plainly what was wrong and give the correct version, then have the student repeat the corrected version before continuing.
- Be honest and direct about mistakes - this is what the student explicitly asked for - but stay respectful and constructive, never mocking, insulting, or demeaning. Correct the language, not the person.
- After corrections, keep the conversation moving naturally so the student gets real practice, not just a lecture.
- Keep each of your turns short (1-3 sentences) so the student talks more than you do.`;
